The gameplay by default is first person, but players have the option to play in third person mode. The core gameplay revolves around breaking and placing blocks. The game world is essentially composed of rough 3D objects\u2014mainly cubes\u2014that are arranged in a fixed grid pattern and represent different materials, such as dirt, stone, various ores, water, and tree trunks. While players can move freely across the world, objects and items can only be placed at fixed locations relative to the grid. Players can gather these material blocks and place them elsewhere, thus allowing for various constructions.",

Events may happen in-game that are not necessarily controlled or planned by the developer, which will help to create a dynamic developing experience for Bungie and a dynamic playing experience for gamers. The game's style has been described a first-person shooter that will incorporate massively multiplayer online game (MMO) elements, but Bungie has avoided defining Destiny as a traditional MMO game. Instead, the game has been referred to as a \"shared-world shooter,\" as it lacks many of the characteristics of a traditional MMO game. For instance, rather than players being able to see and interact with all other players in the game or on a particular server\u2014as is the case in many conventional MMO games\u2014Destiny will include on-the-fly matchmaking that will allow players to see and interact only with other players with whom they are \"matched\" by the game.\nDestiny will incorporate a new game engine that allows global illuminations and real-time dynamic lighting to occur together. An innovation in Bungie's \"hopper\" technology, which has been the backbone for Halo's matchmaking system, will allow better player matchmaking in order to create a more natural experience in either cooperative or competitive multiplayer modes.",

        "description": "12 PLAYER NHL COLLISION PHYSICS\nFor the first time in any sports game, real-world physics affects every player through every on-ice collision with the new 12 Player NHL \u00ae Collision Physics. Utilizing the power of the next generation consoles, and building off the critically-acclaimed NHL Collision Physics system, every player on the ice is governed by physics at all times. Feel the hard-hitting chaos of NHL hockey through true-to-life secondary collisions, net scrambles and player pileups, capturing the desperation of every shift.\n\nREAL PUCK PHYSICS\nThe puck is one of the most complex items in the game to authentically replicate and it finally gets its due in NHL 15. Completely rebuilt puck physics result in a more realistic feel to every puck interaction. Everything on the ice, including the ice surface itself, is live which leads to the unpredictable and authentic puck spins, rolls and bounces seen in a real NHL game.\n\nAUTHENTIC PLAYER & EQUIPMENT MODELS\nThe Next Generation Hockey Player has been rebuilt from the ice up. Now player models have three distinct layers - the body, equipment, and jersey. Each layer interacts independently, making every contact with the puck or other players even more realistic. Dynamic Cloth technology adds an extra layer of realism as it reacts to the player\u2019s movement as they explode up the ice, helping bring the speed of the game to life.\n\nUNPRECEDENTED PLAYER LIKENESS\nPowered by the same technology that brought the most realistic representation of the athlete to EA SPORTS UFC, NHL 15 delivers groundbreaking player likeness, emotion and animation. From the strides a player takes to get up the ice to the emotion on their face after scoring a game winning goal, the players are as real as they\u2019ve ever been.\n\nSUPERSTAR SKILL STICK\nNow all the tools of an NHL superstar are in your hands. The revolutionary Skill Stick has evolved to give even more control to the player. Protect the puck, receive passes without breaking stride, and discover an arsenal of sweet new dekes, all with an intuitive right stick control scheme that is easy to use but packed with depth.\n\nAUTHENTIC ARENAS\nThere is no feeling like being there, and we are giving you the best seats in the house. The power of the next-gen consoles finally allows the NHL franchise to capture every detail of an NHL arena. Unique arena elements from 19,000+ seat capacities to lighting and player entrance tunnels are captured with a level of detail not possible on the previous generation. Now those home games will truly feel like home.\n\nNEW COMMENTARY TEAM\nNew voices for a new generation. NHL 15 welcomes the NBC Sports commentary team of Mike 'Doc' Emrick and Eddie Olczyk to the broadcast booth. TSN analyst Ray Ferraro will provide game insights at ice level. Combined with Real Life Broadcast Integration that will feature real-world pre-game video commentary with Doc and Eddie set against in-game visuals, NHL 15 takes a revolutionary step forward in sports videogames; where the lines between the real world of sport broadcast and the game are blurred.\n\nNBC SPORTS GAME DAY PRESENTATION\nThe most realistic broadcast package in a video game to-date is possible because of a new partnership with NBC Sports. Set the scene with the NHL on NBC crew welcoming you to the city during the game intros and immerse yourself in an experience that matches what you see on television with NHL on NBC graphics and branding.\n\nLIVING CROWDS\nNHL 15 sets a new standard in videogames with over 9,000 individual crowd models with 4x the animations of previous generations. Take a look through the glass and you\u2019ll see fans hold up signs with your name on them, costume wearing superfans, or even sections full of team rivals rooting against you. Feel their behavior change after dropping the gloves, landing a big hit, or scoring a clutch goal. The crowd is alive.\n\nVISION AI\nAn elevated level of player intelligence, Vision AI features evolved awareness with players reading and reacting to potential plays. Scoring area recognition, pass anticipation, and enhanced team breakouts all improve the flow of the game.",

Built with the input of thousands of crazed internet gamers, #IDARB is a chaotic 8-player eSport jumping future arena ball game. Create characters, teams, team logos, tournaments, even your theme music, in this highly customizable experience complete with disruptive \u201chashbombs\u201d which dynamically change the game itself via Twitch and Twitter! IDARB supports up to a whopping 8 simultaneous local players, and up to 4 vs. 4, head-to-head online matches. Additional features include a mind-blowing single-player story mode, wild half time competitions, and unlockable recipes. Begun as a crowd-sourced project, the game\u2019s title is an acronym for \u201cIt Draws a Red Box\u201d (IDARB). Thanks to thousands of suggestions via social media, the game evolved from one red box into the wacky amalgam it is today, complete with hundreds of strange \u201chashbombs\u201d, secret commands which, when sent to the game via Twitch or Twitter, will disrupt and dynamically change the game in realtime! If there\u2019s something you want that isn\u2019t in #IDARB, it\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t suggest it, but with so many customization options, you can probably still make it yourself!",

It is the tenth main title in the Mortal Kombat series and is being developed for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One, with a release scheduled for 2015.\nLike previous entries in the series, Mortal Kombat X is a fighting game in which two players fight against each other using a variety of attacks, special moves, and gruesome Fatalities. The energy meter, first introduced in the previous title, once again allows players to perform techniques such as brutal X-Ray moves, with some refinements made to the system. Similar to NetherRealm Studio's previous title, Injustice: Gods Among Us, fighters can now interact with the environment, bouncing off areas to reposition themselves or using parts of the environment as weapons. Each fighter now has three different variations, each featuring a different set of moves they can use during the match. For example, Scorpion can use the Ninjutsu variation, in which he wields dual swords, or the Hellfire variation, which relies more of fiery special moves. There also plans for fully connected online functionality.\n\nDevelopment\nNetherRealm Studios started publicly hiring for the eighth generation development in April 2012. In July 2013, a new Mortal Kombat game was announced to be in development and was said to be released alongside the film series' reboot in September 2015. At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con, Lance Sloan, producer of the web series Mortal Kombat: Legacy, confirmed the next Mortal Kombat game to be in production, and that there were intentions of a simultaneous release between the game and a new Mortal Kombat film.\n\nIn February 2014, actor Kiefer Sutherland revealed his involvement in this \"huge game.\" According to Karen Strassman's (the voice of Kitana and Mileena in 2011's Mortal Kombat) acting resume, the game's working title was Mortal Kombat 2. The game's poster was leaked and an updated version of the series' iconic dragon logo was revealed on May 28, 2014. Series creator Ed Boon posted daily riddles on his Twitter account that constituted a countdown suggesting a June 2 announcement date with the game's title speculated to be Mortal Kombat X. One of the Twitter clues left by Boon teasing this title was the image of a Lincoln MKX emblem posted with the comment, \"I wonder what the X stands for?\"\n\nOn June 2, 2014, the title was indeed officially revealed as Mortal Kombat X, alongside an official reveal trailer featuring a fight between the iconic characters Scorpion and Sub-Zero. The game made its first public appearance at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, starting on June 10, where four new characters were revealed, apart from the two already revealed by the trailer. NetherRealm Studios themselves are working on only the PS4 and Xbox one versions.",

Michel Ancel, celebrated creator of Rayman\u00ae, Beyond Good & Evil\u00ae and the Raving Rabbids\u00ae is bringing his innovative creativity to this new and exciting platform. Rayman Legends makes full use of the power of the Wii U. With the new Wii U GamePad, discover new ways to platform with its touch-based gameplay, gyroscope technology, and even the ability to extend your playing experience when the TV is off. Additionally, the power of the machine has helped pave the way for new, more detailed graphics and lighting. Rayman, Globox, and the Teensies are off wandering through an enchanted forest when they discover a mysterious tent filled with a series of captivating paintings. As they look more closely, they notice each painting seems to tell the story of a mythical world. While focusing on a painting that shows a medieval land, they are suddenly sucked into the painting, entering the world, and the adventure begins. The gang must run, jump and fight their way through each world to save the day and discover the secrets of every legendary painting.",

The world has a mysterious history, and as you explore you'll be able to uncover pieces of its past. \n\nThe roads are treacherous and unpredictable with obstacles around every corner. Instead of doing laps on a loop, you'll be trying to survive to the end in the quickest time. Since your car has several abilities, it allows you to not only drive fast on the track but also upside down and on buildings and walls! You can also fly to discover new shortcuts and paths. You'll be able to take on the roads alone, or in multiplayer with your friends! \n\nThe game is a spiritual successor to the multi-award winning game Nitronic Rush, created by ourselves and 6 others while attending DigiPen Institute of Technology. It was widely praised for its innovative mechanics, visual style, audio design, and atmosphere.\nKey Features\nAbilities: The cars can perform many unique actions such as boosting, jumping, flying, and rotating to navigate along and around the track. \nAdventure: A single player experience to learn how to play the game as well as unveil a short story about the world's mysterious past. \nMultiplayer: LAN, Online, and Split-Screen play in several modes, such as Sprint as well as Reverse Tag, Stunt, and many others. \nLevel editor: Includes a powerful level editor that can be used to create levels from inside the game and share them with players around the world using Steam Workshop. \nOriginal soundtrack: New music from the composer behind award-winning games like Nitronic Rush, Solace, and The Fourth Wall.",
